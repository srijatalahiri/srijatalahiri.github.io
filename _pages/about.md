_I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student working in the field of theoretical Condensed Matter Physics under the supervision of [Prof. Saurabh Basu](https://www.iitg.ac.in/physics/fac/saurabh/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. 

I joined Prof. Basu's group in the fall of 2021 and since then I have been engaged in studying fascinating properties of higher order topological insulators. 

I have been awarded the prestigious Prime Minister's Research Fellowship in the year 2022 through the lateral entry channel._

**My work**

Topological insulators (TI) are exotic systems that mimic ordinary insulators in their bulk while hosting robust conducting boundary states. A conventioned d-dimensional TI hosts topologically non-trivial states at their d-1 dimensional boundary. Higher order topology is an extension to the field of topological insulators where the manifestation of topology occurs at boundaries of dimension less than d-1. Topological materials in general show contrasting bulk-boundary behaviour. The properties of these systems are highly robust causing them to be stable under minor perturbations that do not disturb the symmetries of the Hamiltonian.
