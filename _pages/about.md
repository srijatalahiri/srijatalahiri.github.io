I am a 4th year Ph.D. student working in the field of theoretical Condensed Matter Physics under the supervision of [Prof. Saurabh Basu](https://www.iitg.ac.in/physics/fac/saurabh/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. 

I joined Prof. Basu's group in the fall of 2021 and since then I have been engaged in studying fascinating properties of higher order topological insulators. 

I have been awarded the prestigious Prime Minister's Research Fellowship in the year 2022 through the lateral entry channel.

**My work**

Topological insulators (TI) are exotic systems that mimic ordinary insulators in their bulk while hosting robust conducting boundary states. A conventional d-dimensional TI hosts topologically non-trivial states at their d-1 dimensional boundary. Higher order topology is an extension to the field of topological insulators where the manifestation of topology occurs at boundaries of dimension less than d-1 for a d-dimensional bulk. Topological materials in general show contrasting bulk-boundary behaviour. The properties of these systems are highly robust causing them to be stable under minor perturbations that do not disturb the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. 

One of the major puzzles in the field of higher order topological insulators (HOTI) involves devising a mechanims to gap out the surface/edge states of a 3D/2D TI to transform them to an HOTI. Another aspect involves associating a suitable bulk topological invariant that establishes a refined bulk-boundary correspondence between the topological corner/hinge states and the bulk of the system. Currently, the interplay of topology with non-Hermiticity, disorder and drive is being widely explored. Such an interplay brings about various novel phenomena not exhibited by Hermitian, clean and static systems respectively.

My work involves theoretical investigation of systems that exhibit first order topological features and formulate a way to transform the first order bulk topology to higher order and consequently study the response of the topological invariant.
