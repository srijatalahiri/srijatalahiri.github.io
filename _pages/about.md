_I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student working in the field of theoretical Condensed Matter Physics under the supervision of [Prof. Sourabh Basu](https://www.iitg.ac.in/physics/fac/saurabh/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. I joined Prof. Basu's group in the fall of 2021 and since then I have been engaged in studying fascinating properties of higher order topological insulators. I have been awarded the prestigious Prime Minister's Research Fellowship in the year 2022 through the lateral entry channel._

**My work**

 Higher order topology is an extension to the field of topological insulators. Topological insulators in general refer to systems which show contrasting bulk-boundary behaviour. The properties of these systems are highly robust causing them to be stable under minor perturbations that do not disturb the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. I am involved in theoretically studying systems that show topological features and how they behave under various perturbations.

**Education**

I graduated in 2018 with a B.Sc. (Honours) in Physics from Bethune College, University of Calcutta and an M.Sc. in Physics in 2020 from Jawaharlal Nehru University. I completed my M.Sc. project under the supervision of Prof. Brijesh Kumar.
