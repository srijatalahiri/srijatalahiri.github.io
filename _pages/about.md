I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student working in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Sourabh Basu.

I joined Dr. Basu's group in the spring of 2021 and since then I have been engaged in studying fascinating properties of Higher order topological insulators. My research focuses on this and that. Some questions partially addressed in my work are: 1. This 2.That 3. This and That

Earlier, I studied these things using theoretical techniques from quantum physicss and many-body physics with Prof. Someone.

I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelors (Honours) in Physics from this college and Masters in Physics in 2020 from Jawaharlal Nehru University. In my Masters research I investigated these things. I was advised by Prof. This Guy.
