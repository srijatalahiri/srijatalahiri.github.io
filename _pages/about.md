I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student working in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics under the supervision Prof. Sourabh Basu at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati.

I joined Dr. Basu's group in the spring of 2021 and since then I have been engaged in studying fascinating properties of higher order topological insulators (HOTIs). ...

I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelors (Honours) in Physics from Bethune College, University of Calcutta and Masters in Physics in 2020 from Jawaharlal Nehru University. BSc and MSc project work if you want to mention them.
