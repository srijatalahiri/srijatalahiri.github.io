title: "Higher order topology in a band deformed Haldane model"
collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'Haldane model is a celebrated tight binding toy model in a 2D honeycomb lattice that exhibits quantized Hall conductance in the absence of an external magnetic field. In our work, we deform the bands of the Haldane model smoothly by varying one of its three nearest neighbour hopping amplitudes ($$t_1$$), while keeping the other two ($$t$$) fixed. This breaks the $$C_3$$ symmetry of the Hamiltonian, while the $$M_x*T$$ symmetry is preserved. The symmetry breaking causes the Dirac cones to shift from the $$K$$ and the $$K'$$ points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) to an intermediate $$M$$ point.'
